ljz 19990108: Reenabled ljz's code: Replace uncompressed by compressed pixeldata VR in
              SaveToDisk (it seemed to work anyway...)
MvH 19990109: Removed some commented out code; added comments for alternative load and save routines
	      Added Regen of specified device

MvH 19990827: Optimized read of slices: cache a DB to pass to GetFileName (10% faster)
ljz 19991117: Added parameter FileCompressMode to in nki_private_compress call
mvh 20000318: Added private command object 9999, 0300 = print to console
              Added private command object 9999, 0400 = force C-Echo to be 'silent' (no log)
              Display C-Move Destination; print time info about threads
ljz 20000323: Serious fix: MainThread 'hangs' when several associations occur simultaneously, caused
	      by compiler-optimisation. Solution: DriverApp.Lock should be 'volatile'.
mvh 20000329: On request by ljz: designed crash of server if silent VR receives 'DEAD'
ljz 20000501: Compare dicom modality with UPPER-case ini-file setting (ExportConverters)
ljz 20000221: Initialize TroubleLogFile and UserLogFile; log C-STORE and C-MOVE
ljz 20000703: Logging of trouble now starts with '***'
mvh 20000703: Exclude archival messages from trouble log; removed force dcm code
mvh 20001104: Added WINAPI to thread routines
mvh 20001105: Replaced malloc by new where a mix could occur (vr->data)
              Made compilable for MSC and BC and WC using some #ifdefs
              Changed order of verification and store; better localized new/delete DDO more
mvh 20001106: Run-time load odbcinst routine for BC and WC, use spawn... i/s/o _spawn...           
mvh 20001106: Use delete [] operation for vr->Data
mvh 20010328: Added -av: verify mirror disk
mvh 20010415: Added DeleteSeries, DeleteStudy and DeleteImage routines and -f options
mvh 20010416: Added -f options: -feFile = enter MAGN file into DB, -fdFile = delete file from DB
	      -faFile = add (also makes copy) file into server, -f?=ask UID of file, 
	      -fu = generate UID, -fcNEWPATID,file = modify patient ID of image file (moves file!)
	      NOTE: -fc is irreversible in the sense that if a portion of a study/series is changed
              and changed back it winds up as a different study/series. This occurs because the 
	      UIDs must be changed for each image modification. This problem does not occur when 
	      a whole series or study is changed
mvh 20010417: Simplified code to change uids to allow easy extension to referenced SOPs
              Check after load on common UIDs to avoid accepting dropped non-dicom files
              NOTE: ChangeUIDinDDO should also change sequences and referenced SOPs (0008,1155)
mvh 20010418: Fix in above change
mvh 20010418: Changed names of database fields in UIDMODS - did not work on msaccess
mvh 20010419: Added -fk option: copy image file to other patient ID (as -fc but no delete)
              Added version number 1.3.9 to command line help
mvh 20010429: Added -fz option: zap file from server and database
mvh 20010430: Some work on read ahead thread: note that thread must not use any pointer copy!
mvh 20010502: Made read ahead thread working; fixed thread counter; fix odbc option: strings too short
mvh 20020506: Fixed handle leak in read ahead thread
mvh 20020507: Fixed memory leak in read ahead thread; kbhit() test #ifdef DO_LEAK_DETECTION
mvh 20010509: Added RenameDevice is -ae option
ljz 20010730: Replaced parameter argv[0] of ExportConverters to proper value
mvh 20010829: Added ExportStationName as export filter; default Export... value set to "*"

mvh 20010831: Added extended syntax for exportconverters with %f=filename, %m=modality, 
              %s=stationname, %b=file base name, %p=file path; 
              Also allows 'copy %f destination', but for windows NT only (uses cmd.exe)
              Added ExportFilter option that uses an SQL statement to filter.
mvh 20010901: Added a simple queue to process exportconverters asynchroniously
mvh 20010901: Create a queue for each converter; queue mirror copy requests
mvh 20010902: Added %o = SOP; %n = newline; added the following hard coded converters: 
              append "text" to file; write "text" to file; copy file to file; copy file to dir
ljz 20010904: Re-entered change of 20010730
ljz 20010905: Fix: After 'SaveToDisk', do not free pDDO
mvh 20011109: Fix: made ExportConverter stuff case insensitive
              Note: empty filter tests for empty contents - this is not the same as '*'
              Released 1.3.10
mvh 20011110: Note: in release 1.3.10, the " to " in e.g., write "%f%n" to file must be lowercase
mvh 20011115: Made " to" case insensitive; Added *** before some error messages for better logging
              Removed cache db: would hang the server if SQL has gone down and up.
              Now use one DB per thread which is passed to the read ahead thread = fast too!
ljz 20011207: Added extra errormessage when creation of datasource fails
mvh 20020109: Disabled this code for watcom or borland (instead of run-time loading an address)
mvh 20020314: Implemented ignore of C-CANCEL request for ADAC NM (was error before)
              Blocked out SQLInstallerError call; does not compile on clinical MS4.2
mvh 20020413: Added some notes about thread safety and db's: The serverchild is not thread 
              safe when reading and writing is done on the same association.
mvh 20020415: Added -atDEVICE option: sanity check of images on disk; version to 1.3.11
mvh 20020416: Made UID generator configurable through UIDPrefix in dicom.ini; made time print unsigned
mvh 20020422: Sleazy fix of ModifyPatID: time(null) created same UID: now wait 1 s per changed file
mvh 20020426: Generate filename no longer gives an error: is done at higher level
mvh 20020428: Only serious error messages use *** in message
mvh 20020428: Added FAILSAFE_STORAGE: tries to save incoming files even when DB errors occur
mvh 20020429: Put SaveToDisk in myUnknownStorage: pass DB failures to caller
              Disabled FAILSAFE_STORAGE: any storage failures should now be detected by client
mvh 20020508: Do not rewrite image not on MAG but it is not an error (warning is generated earlier)
mvh 20020520: Added -gSERVER,DATE option: grab images on date from remote server

              uppercase after retrieving IP and port.
ljz 20020613: Better handling of Compression ON/OFF in 'SaveToDisk'
	      Fixed crash in DeleteImageFile (twice free of VR->Data)
mvh 20020613: compress to specified mode, check (de)compress result, decompresses data before 
              forward; added 'export compressed to AE' export; -fa has optional ,NEWPATID syntax;

              Version to 1.3.12 (unreleased)
mvh 20020804: Use PATHSEPCHAR where possible
mvh 20020807: Changed SaveToDisk order: only make patientdir when DB save succeeded
mvh 20020812: Added skeleton of printer support
mvh 20020816: Added color imagebox; Save incoming print DDO as file
mvh 20020819: UIDs of imageboxes end on rows.cols.position for easy print handling
mvh 20020819: Fix in delete unexistent mirror files for changepatientUID
              Extract pixel data from sequence in ImageBox; added sleep(10) in -fk option
mvh 20020819: Added better UID generation (but gets close to 64 chars)
mvh 20020821: Fix printer UID generation; display page orientation and film #; shorter info
mvh 20021016: Added (indexed) patid to exportfilter query and getfilename for speed; 
              The option tests for rev5 db or higher; increase 64 strings to 66;
              Note: the GrabImagesFromServer option does not yet pass patid to the query 
	      (i.e., will be slow with non-odbc driver)
mvh 20021017: Control NeedPack from here; added -c option: set UID counter at startup
              Removed Sleep from anonimize options; do not re-create UIDMODS

mvh 20021105: Revamped read-ahead thread logic to try fix rare crash where ratd->DDOOutPtr became NULL
mvh 20021115: Use Generic style retrieve classes with NKIqrsop code instead of older qrsop code
              Advantages: read ahead thread used, and allows print of error messages from C-MOVE
              Required changes such that ratd->pcdo can be NULL.
mvh 20021121: Disabled read-ahead thread for time being
mvh 20021212: Also loop ServerApp.Server(Port) in threaded mode server
mvh 20021213: Re-entered fix by Hanne Kooy: compressed forwarding had extra ;
mvh 20021213: Re-enabled use of generic query classes with read-ahead thread; 
	      but made read-ahead thread configurable with "EnableReadAheadThread"
              Made grab query faster by including date - note grab is independent of FixPhilips
mvh 20021215: Found read-ahead thread problem reported by Aaron Cann - missing Sleep in wait for slices
mvh 20021223: Version to 1.4.1 pre-release; added in dgatefn forbidden filename chars suggest by Thomas Buerer
mvh 20030113: Removed loop ServerApp.Server(Port): gave endless loop error messages
ljz 20030120: Added cleanup-code when DO_LEAK_DETECTION is defined for easy leak checking

                  Also fix 2 other potential missing VR problems
mvh 20030228: Fixed bug reported by Jeff Bacbcock: series retrieve from E-film crashed (patid not passed)
ljz 20030424: Version to 1.3.12
	      Changed calls to obsolete PDU.Write(&DDO)
	      In 'SaveToDisk' the call to PDU.SaveDICOMDataObject now has parameterDICOM_CHAPTER_10_EXPLICIT
	      (which in writes IMPLICIT files iff not compressed)
ljz 20030606: Fixed incremental counter when creating UIDs or generating filenames
	      Fix: QueryRetrieveLevel is mandatory for a QueryResponse
mvh 20030625: Fix NGET of BasicPrinterSOPClass
ljz 20030625: Fix in above fix

              Added 'forward compressed as xx to ...'
mvh 20030701: QualifyOn now also has compression parameter
mvh 20030703: Moved compression code to nkiqrsop; dgate -j-xx and -j*xx = test compression options
	      Removed "forward compressed to" because "forward compressed as .. to" is better.
	      Note that FileCompressMode is now obsolete. KNOWN BUG: JPEG compressed images may be 
	      rewritten as V2 (when written originally as NKI) which are then not correctly read.
mvh 20030704: Made that FileCompressMode parameter still works even though is obsolete
              Moved faulty delete DDO after SOPUnknownStorage.Read
mvh 20030705: Added check of Tranfer Syntax next to extension for save type; ProcessDDO takes **DDO

mvh 20040607: Merged fix ljz 20040602; do not allow rename and delete with empty name
mvh 20040610: Added maintenance server tasks for archival and regeneration
mvh 20040612: Added indexdbf maintenance server task
mvh 20040614: dgate command line maintenance options use NeedPack=5: non-threaded index generation

mvh 20041109: Added $tSERVER test compressed forward; some fixes in forward compressed to (server name read wrong)
              $s tests all filename syntaxes
mvh 20041112: Added $rN N times repeated entry test, and $tN which enters image N time each on its own thread
mvh 20041128: Added -^file: log to file (timestamped) instead of to server console; -#file: same with debug
mvh 20041129: Added silent commands debuglog_on and log_on to set logging to UDP or file
	      Added silent command read_amap to re-read acrnema.map without restarting the server
mvh 20050102: Small modifications to allow compile through total.cxx
mvh 20050107: Added code to hold and retry queued forwards and mirror copies when failed:
              After failed export/copy, start storing entries in file ExportFailuresN (CopyFailures)
	      if a new export/copy is requested >1 minute after last failed one, try again
              if queue is empty, >100 seconds after last fail, try export/copy stored ones
              processing queued entries has priority over processing stored entries
mvh 20050107: Version to 1.4.8; modifications for linux compile
mvh 20050108: Added server PORT# to fail files, so that multiple servers on different ports do not share files

	      dgate -- sends server commands to other running server; adapted manual
mvh 20050121: Small updates to manual
mvh 20050124: Replaced BackGroundExec with simpler system() for Linux; added query server command, e.g.,
	      dgate "--query:DICOMpatients|patientid,patientname,patientsex|patientsex='F'|%s %s %s|t.t"
              Added read_ini: server command to reread dicom.ini; changes most config except:
              TCPPort (busy), UseBuiltInDecompressor (cached) and FileNameSyntax (cached)
mvh 20050130: added get_param, get_freestore, get_amap, get_sqldef that respond through echo-response
	      also: get_sop, get_transfer, get_application, get_localae, get_remoteae, get_dic, forward
	      added: dump_header (to file), convert_to_gif (to file); adapted query (to file) 
	      where file="cgi" for stdout in cgi/mime mode, file="" to send to stdout as is
	      most GUI commands can now pass PatientID|SOPInstanceUID instead of filename of dicom object
              added put_amap, write_amap, put_sop, put_transfer, put_application, put_localae, put_remoteae, 
	      put_param. Note: get/put_param work through disk (read_ini activates), get/put_amap through 
              memory (write_amap writes to disk), get/put_sop etc read from memory and write to mem and disk.
mvh 20050204: Added delete_param, delete_amap and fix cgi output (double \n)
mvh 20050204  most GUI commands can now pass PatientID|?*:SOPInstanceUID; added delete sop etc commands
	      More fixes in cgi data passing VR vr() is mostly wrong; use VR *vr=new VR()
mvh 20050205: Allow up to 16 output fields in query:, repeat queried fields over all 16 outputs
	      Added counters for server status; start on display_status server command
mvh 20050206: More work at display_status, renamed testtable to xtesttable: default not opened
	      Access ObjectFile and DeviceName through query instead of with GetFileName up to 3 x faster!!
	      Also fixes potential leak in read ahead thread: pats, series and studies not always freed
	      Allow up to 32 cgi query outputs, tidied dump layout, start on web interface (put dgate and ini in cgi-bin)
mvh 20050207: Added query2 option: limits number of output rows as asked; gui command not counted as association
              Some more work for web interface
mvh 20050210: Adapted web interface queries such that they run on sql server
mvh 20050212: Removed need for thread local storage; automatically adapt dgate extension in cgi scripts depending in OS

mvh 20050603: Fix servercommand query(2) for empty where part
mvh 20050825: Fix web interface queries for sql server (were OK for dbase)
mvh 20050826: More work on web interface and added worklist there; deleterecord command

	      use rat also for single image access to avoid code duplication
mvh 20051209: Start on virtual query: image (!) query is passed to other server, results populate db
mvh 20051210: Added "vX" incomingcompression (stores dbf but not image; forwarding disabled)
              Added virtual queries on all queries and moves: now works as transparant file cache
	      Added VirtualServerFor0..9 configuration entries: server merges own data with these AE's
	      Added CacheVirtualData control; if set data not deleted after use (db kept for now)
mvh 20051211: Fix: override query level in virtual query
mvh 20051212: Store virtual server # in device; saved on query, used when retrieving, stripped when storing

              Fixed doc of --regendir: command
mvh 20051219: Fixed several small leaks - as tested with Linux malloc_stats
mvh 20051222: Started on bypass server for virtual query - not functional yet (cleanup required)
              Removed debugVR logic: errors should now list DCO
mvh 20051228: Fix virtual device logic for VirtualServerFor0; 
              Cleanup vr's and duplicates when bypassing server for virtual query, seems functional
mvh 20051229: NonDestructiveDumpDICOMObject now also list sequences;

mvh 20060128: Renamed to imagelister, added serieslister
mvh 20060131: Sort filenames from imagelister on ImageNumber (0020,0013)
mvh 20060226: Version to 1.4.11
mvh 20060228: Small fix in isxdigit thanks to ljz
mvh 20060311: Use ReplaceVR in virtual query - level was sent twice (thanks David Lang)
	      Added WEBReadOnly flag
mvh 20060317: Support calledae and callingae in filenamesyntax - for virtualquery called is always MYACRNEMA
mvh 20060324: Strip group 2 from outgoing c-stores if not compression "as" or "is"
mvh 20060328: Improved forwarder, always propose Verification and use IsAbstractSyntaxAccepted(iUID) to test if host accepts image
mvh 20060402: Fix hang condition when a file failed to read in the read-ahead thread
mvh 20060402: Do not remove transfer syntax prior to dcmdjpeg/dcmcjpeg (here in test recompress only)
mvh 20060405: Tried fix for multiple moves on same assoc (thanks Andrej Savelov)

mvh 20060619: Set version to 1.4.12alpha1
mvh 20060621: Added clonedb: command; transfer FULL db from other server to this one using virtualquery
mvh 20060628: AddToDatabase has JustAdd parameter: skip one unnecessary query
mvh 20060701: Speeded filter string handling
mvh 20060702: Pass DB to GenerateFilename to avoid zillions of db open and closes
mvh 20060704: Print number of records found in all queries
mvh 20060708: Set version to 1.4.12alpha
mvh 20061126: Moved servertask temporary files to MAG0/printer_files; protected query: and query2 against empty input
mvh 20061126: Experimental forwarding on same association: close unused association after 5 seconds
              Clean collected sopclasses after one hour of inactivity
	      Note 1: there is a problem with AReleaseRQ: do not use in this task
	      Note 2: maximal 20 forwarders have a remaining association
mvh 20061127: Added ForwardAssociationLevel (PATIENT, SERIES, STUDY, IMAGE, SOPCLASS; default STUDY),
	      ForwardAssociationRefreshDelay (default 3600 s), and ForwardAssociationCloseDelay (default 5 s)
              Limit maximum number of ExportConverters to MAXExportConverters=20 (for static arrays used in forwarders)
	      Forwarders keep association open as long as UID at ForwardAssociationLevel does not change.
              Show filename in forward log; document where fixkodak should operate for virtual queries
mvh 20061128: Added ForwardAssociationLevel GLOBAL: use association until timout or incompatible
              Close ForwardAssociation after send when ForwardAssociationLevel is IMAGE
mvh 20061129: VirtualServerForN may be "server,FIXKODAK" to clean queries (add 0) and their response (remove 0)
	      Hardcoded filters for exportconverters (modality, called, calling, station) can now match e.g., RT*
mvh 20061130: Pass series and study in virtualserver outgoing c-move
mvh 20061213: Fixed nasty bug in query2 and TestFilter: Query without bindfield overwrites previous bound strings!
	      Maybe was problem causing crash on linux with query2: and problem with option -g reportedly stopping incorrectly
mvh 20061219: Version to 1.4.12
mvh 20061231: Added ForwardAssociationRelease to allow testing reconnect problem (default 0 = just hangup)
mvh 20070103: FixKodak blocks *xxxx wildcard virtual queries on date (not allowed in Kodak)
mvh 20070103: Version to 1.4.12b; start on ImportConverters e.g., <set 0008,1040 to "%V0008,0080">
mvh 20070104: ImportConverters %QP %QS %QE %QW; <destroy> <delete xxxx,yyyy> <save to filename>
              Added %% and %i to Export and Import converters
mvh 20070105: <set 0008,1040 if "...">, <setifempty 0008,1040 to "...">, <setifempty 0008,1040 if "...">
              Import/export converters only report when syntax OK and report when action is void
	      Added %Vxxxx,yyyy to export converters and %d(date/time) to import and export converters
              An import/export converter can thus be used to extensively log incoming images
              Added import converters: <stop>, <if "string">, <ifempty "string">, <nop> (also export)
              Added general purpose variables x, y, z (read as %x, %y, %z) to import converters
	      Definition of number of ImportConverters now unnecessary.
              Note: importconverter and exportconverter strings may be changed run-time in dicom.ini
mvh 20070105: Some fixes in dgate --archiving options manual; fixed dgate --restoremagflags:
mvh 20070107: Fix web access broken by change in odbci for dbaseIII; query must now always include spaces around =
mvh 20070113: Do not store NKI compressed data in v2 format: decompress and give error message
              Recompress to NKI format now enables StripGroup2; Tested with $c server debug command
mvh 20070117: Allow multiple rules per Export or ImportConverter separated by ; and zero or more spaces
              <nop> statement prints itself on console: useful for logging anything that follows
mvh 20070117: Now maintain multiple connections per ExportConverter line (max 20x20 forwards)
	      Added <stop>, <silentstop>, <if> and <ifempty> to ExportConverters; but they only affect single rule 
	      (while these would cross over to the subsequent rules in ImportConverters)
mvh 20070122: Now also show free space on mirror devices
mvh 20070123: Fixed TestFilter for patientid with '
mvh 20070125: Removed <if> and added <ifnotempty>, <ifequal>, <ifnotequal>, <ifmatch>, <ifnotmatch>, 
	      <ifnumequal>, <ifnumnotequal>, <ifnumgreater>, <ifnumless> as im/exportconverters
              Added %xxx[first,last] substring operator; and protect it against overrange
              <ifxxx> no longer crosses over importconverters; added {} block for im/exportconverters
              E.g.: ifequal "%V0008,0020[0,3]", "2004"; { forward to CONQUESTSRV3; forward to CONQUESTSRV4; } nop test
	      Note: 1) all (also ifxxxx) statements end with ; 2) statements may begin with { or }; 
              3) extra spaces only allowed after ;{} and single space after ,
mvh 20070127: Fix {} in exportconverters.
              Release 1.4.12b to fix more or less critical odbci error
mvh 20070131: Fix in TestFilter (quotes double); Version to 1.4.12c
mvh 20070201: Added <storage MAGn> import converter: sets device to store this (new) image to (default MAG0)
              Fixed importconverters stop and destroy: did not break current line
mvh 20070204: Added extra format starting with # to ImageFileLister: e.g. #%s:%s prints MAG0:filename
mvh 20070206: Added create database: dgate -esapw name user password 
mvh 20070207: Fix query string bug on applyworklist found by capolan1
mvh 20070207: dgate -e name root <blank> works for mysql: root is used as admin and login
              Also implemented dgate -esapw name sa sapw where sapw may be empty
mvh 20070210: Added CheckDuplicates to UpdateOrAddToTable; added @ in imagefilelister: replace \ by /
              Start on ocx based viewer integrated in cgi interface; used dicom over http:
              Small change in gif export; added * as separator in query/2
mvh 20070211: Added WebScriptAddress (default http://server/cgi-bin/dgate), WebMAG0Address (defaults http://server/mag0)
              and WebServerFor (default 127.0.0.1). Fix in cgi query parser: now loads dsize and size correctly
              Version to 1.4.12d
mvh 20070212: Added WebCodeBase, show version in status_display, added config of which dicom server the web server
	      connects to, added [webdefaults] section, added iconsize parameter
mvh 20070213: Added : as format in imagefilelister: use to list pat:sopuid
              Fixed sorting problem by using adapted imagefilelister for seriesviewer
	      Fixed default for WebCodebase; Version to 1.4.12e; 
	      Use correct case of sql table names in cgi interface: required by mysql on linux
	      Unsolved: n3 does not always decompress correctly in dview.pas see p20401977:i47, changed default to n4
mvh 20070215: Fixed logging and added *** Association rejected message when association is rejected
mvh 20070304: Added <defer> exportconverter: retry later as if connection unavailable
mvh 20070305: Note: n3 problem fixed in dview.pas, version to 1.4.13alpha

              Allow named pipes for log_on and debuglog_on
mvh 20070307: Work on extending extract: allow e.g. SQlite -> dbaseIII
bcb 20070308: Made changes for big endian and Apple's DARWIN
mvh 20070314: Fisished extract: allow e.g. SQlite -> dbaseIII in directory MAGO dbase
mvh 20070315: Merged DARWIN stuff; Set TCPIPTimeOut for PDU that moves images
mvh 20070316: Display defer import converter; Clumsily added <compression> import converter and 
              improved <storage> import converter; Made <storage> thread safe
	      Failed recompress() no longer reason to fail drag and drop; add convert_to_bmp
	      Use | instead of , to separate patientid from file in addimagefile:
              Distributed , code to each of the server commands to make it more , safe
              Note: it is NOT a good idea to use a , in a flexible filenamesyntax
	      Added level & window to convert_to_gif and convert_to_bmp; longer log lines for dump VR
mvh 20070317: <prefetch> using new prefetch_queue, mayprocess and into_queue_unique, <preforward>, <preget>
mvh 20070324: preget now <preretrieve> and avoids looping by checking orgmessageid!=0xfbad
              I.e., data collected by <preretrieve> does not go through import/exportconverters
              Added delayed exportconverters <forward patient>, <forward study>, <forward series> with optional compression
              Removed "forward compressed to" (without as section) as is never used
	      Version to 1.4.13beta; delay to 10 minutes

              Also put in a more ENxxxx as command and messageid
ljz 20070404: Added CommaInFilenameWorkAround()
mvh 20070407: Use reentrant ctime_r when available; moved static SOPPatientRootQuery etc to stack to fix 
	      reentrancy problem: concurrent outgoing c-move of CT and MRI on different associations would 
	      share PDU causing sopclass not accepted on one. Also seems to reduce linux crash problems on 
	      multiple inbound (4 or more) C-stores. Also moved CreateBasicFilmSessionRequest etc to fix 
	      potential reentrance problem for printing.
mvh 20070410: Merged CommaInFilenameWorkAround()
mvh 20070413: "extract:" will just create dbase III clone of full patient DB; added "prefetch" server command
mvh 20070415: Added Prefetcher option to dicom.ini: is set will aggresively preread queried patient or studies

mvh 20070705: extract: uses DT_DBASEIIINOINDEX to disable indexing and packing when extracting from e.g. sqlite to dbaseiii
              Note: extract: non dbaseIII goes to MAG0\dbase, dbaseIII goes to DataSource
mvh 20070706: Added <between "9", "17"> (9:00 to 16:59) or <between "17", "9"> (17:00 to 08:59) import/exportconverter
mvh 20070709: Fixed print of clone db done
mvh 20070720: Fixed problem where waiting "forward ... to " task caused high CPU load
mvh 20070901: Added dgate --checklargestmalloc:
mvh 20071027: Added ForwardCollectDelay for delayed forwarding (default 600 sec)
mvh 20071030: Fill in called and calling AE for SaveToDisk for e.g., dropped files etc

	      Log flow control Export and ImportConverters only in debug mode
	      Added retrying to delayed forwards or prefetches
mvh 20071102: SetDicomErrorHandler: orderly shutdown of server on serious DICOM library errors
	      Fixed a bug in ForwardAssociationLevel: last UID was lost when reading INI file to szTemp
	      Added MaximumExportRetries and MaximumDelayedFetchForwardRetries (default=0 is no maximum)
mvh 20071103: Version to 1.4.13; defer resets queue fails -> keeps on retrying
mvh 20071104: Use local as AE for imagelister in web page instead of CONQUESTSRV1
	      Enable remote servers (use AE instead of 'local') in finder and lister commands
	      Fix crash when dgate -- option gets empty filename: now lists to stdout
mvh 20071114: Put --checklargestmalloc: in dgate -?
mvh 20071118: Adapted for 64 bits (use SQLLEN for BindField)
mvh 20071120: Fixed KodakFixer for empty patient ID (crashed on 64 bits only)
              Added [modality xx] and [date yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd] clauses to export [patient|study|series] to AE
mvh 20071121: Added %V*GGGG,EEEE: search VR in any sequence; version to 1.4.13a
              Added [now -ddd+ddd] and [age -ddd+ddd] clauses to export [patient|study|series] to AE
	      No retry on remote dicom error in forward xxx to: would retry zero records response
              Use study date for data, age and now clauses
mvh 20071123: Made forward command case insensitive; added forward image; added get [patient|study|series|image] from AE
	      The latter option makes preretrieve obsolete
mvh 20071124: Added [sop xxx] clause to [forward|get]
              Reorganized exportconverter code: all converters now do % substitution; reduced code duplication
              Added reading of sequence items like in %V/300c,0060.0/0008,1155 or %V/300c,0060/0008,1155
	      Real life example (must all be one one line, max 512 characters): 
              ifnotequal "%m", "RTPLAN"; stop; 						nop "tests modality = RTPLAN";
	      ifnotequal "%V*300a,00b2[0,1]", "A2"; stop; 				nop "test machine name = A2"
	      forward to XVI_A2; 							nop "forwards the current recieved RTPLAN";
	      get study modality CT from NKIPACS; 					nop "collects associated CT";
	      get study modality RTSTRUCT sop %V/300c,0060.0/0008,1155 from NKIPACS; 	nop "collects associated RTSTRUCT";
	      forward study modality CT imagetype *AXIAL* to XVI_A2; 			nop "forwards associated CT";
	      forward study modality CT series %V(/300c,0060/0008,1155)/3006,0010/3006,0012/3006,0014/0020,000e     
	      forward study modality RTSTRUCT sop %V/300c,0060.0/0008,1155 to XVI_A2; 	nop "forwards associated RTSTUCT";
mvh 20071125: Fixed syntax for %V/gggg,eeee.i/ *gggg,eeee (search all groups under a specified one)
mvh 20071126: Start on StorageCommitment
mvh 20080103: Switched to ms7 compiler; fixed forward and get date, modality, sop filters: would not supress the UIDs
